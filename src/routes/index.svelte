    Hi! Welcome to my personal website. I'm Shashwot KC. This website shows my personal projects and what I get up to in a regular basis. It is also me learning
    a frontend framework to become a full stack engineer. I'm currently a backend engineer with some server skills to boot. This website was made with svelte.
    
    Blog under construction.
